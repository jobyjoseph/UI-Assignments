There is an `index.ts` file in `src` folder. `package.json` file contains the command to compile the TS file.

You need to:

- Install required packages in the project
- Compile the TS code and store the output in `/dist` folder
- The output JavaScript file needs to be an ES6 code
- Along with the output JavaScript file, a TypeScript declaration file `index.d.ts` should also be generated.
